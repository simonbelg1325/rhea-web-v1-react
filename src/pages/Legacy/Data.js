On one side stand alone applications that fill in a specific role within your organization and use a specific pre-defined data pool (for example managing order processes for a specific department such as engineering) and on the other side a central application or data framework that will group together different application and share your data between them to optimize cost and workload.',

We do this by revising existing applications and re-writing them to ensure full usage of your data as well as grouping together these applications and through our open approach optimize the actual communication between them.'
