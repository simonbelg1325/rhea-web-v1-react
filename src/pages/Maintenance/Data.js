      'In today’s global economy, businesses are finding that traditional IT strategies for growth are no longer sufficient. This growth by acquisitions or faster Go-to-Market campaigns has a big impact on IT strategies and its employees. IT departments are asked to discover innovation, open up new markets, and exploit new technologies to gain sustainable competitive advantage.',
      'However, some companies use their IT department personnel for supporting existing applications and leave them with less time to assist business growth.',
      'Maintaining business as usual within the IT departments is not only costly, it also hampers growth and success, for example',
      '1. IT departments cannot reduce operating costs because they are bogged down by inefficient processes and spending more than 50% of their time responding to calls and emails from users.',
      '2. Projects tend to get into a never ending story because of the unclear separation of Servicedesk and Project or Development;',
      '3. Calls from users come between the daily tasks of IT personnel thus creating project and development delays',
      '4. Users sometimes have different working hours then IT personel',
      'At Rhea we have more than 20 years of experience in maintaning, supporting and further developing of those Business applications that create the bottle-neck for companies to expand their growth.'
